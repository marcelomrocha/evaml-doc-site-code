# Random

The `<random>` command generates a random integer in the closed range [min, max]. The command has two attributes, **min**, representing the lower limit, and **max**, determining the upper limit of the random number to be generated. The value generated by the random function is stored in a special region of the robotâ€™s memory, which works with a array. The $ character accesses the element at the end of the array. This detail will be explained more clearly later in the text. In the following example, a random integer in the range [1, 3] will be generated and the robot will speak a text, including the generated value, using the $ character.
